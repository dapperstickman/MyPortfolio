    <h1>Pop Up</h1>
    <p>A pop up that reminds you to get off your computer.
      We want to limit the amount of time we spend on the computer,
      so we set a timer than makes a pop up to remind us to get up for 30 minutes.
      There is a "I'm in the middle of a project button" that allows you to continue going if needed,
      but otherwise the popup won't go away unless you take a 30 minute break.</p>
